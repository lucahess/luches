## 6. Cell location  

According to UniProt, foxP2 is located in the nucleus. It is involved in
speech language disorder 1 (SPCH1). It causes severe orofacial dyspraxia resulting in
incomprehensible speech. The natural variant is a non-synonymous mutation that exchanges
arginine for histidine (locus: 553).

## 8. BLAST Cat  

The "gap open" and "gap extension" penalties are part of the criteria used to score an alignment. They are different, because evolutionarily it is more difficult to open up a gap
compared to extending one (so "gap open" is a higher negative score).

## 11. A recent evolutionary change affects a regulatory element in the human FOXP2 gene  

The assumption was that there are two amino acid substitutions which occured after the divergence of humans from the neanderthals.
However with examining DNA from neanderthals it showed that they have the two substitution as well and therefore couldn't be the cause for the positive selection for language and speech.
This finding led to the search of a new variant which could be the cause of the selective sweep between neanderthals and homo sapiens.
This paper concentrated on finding such nucleotide changes and found a possible new cause for the positive selective sweep.
They compared DNA from Neanderthals with the present-day human genome and found that the transcription factor POU3F2 could have been that nucleotide change in question.
POU3F2 is a transcription factor which activates the FOXP2 and is exclusively present in the central nervous system.
The present derived allele of POU3F2 shows a loss of function and the paper is making the assumption that this could have been the reason for the loss of one functional copy of FOXP2 and further even the cause for the development of our language of speech.  


## 12. Humanized Foxp2 accelerates learning by enhancing transitions from declarative to procedural performance  

For their paper Christiane Schreiweis et al. created mouse lines with human foxp2 alles.
Those differ by wt alleles by two amino acid substitudes which are highly conserved in humans.
FOXP2 is the sole gene to date firmly linked to speech and language development.
They find that humanized Foxp2 mice has an effect on behavioral learning dynamics as well as on striatal dopamine levels, gene expression levels, and synaptic plasticity.
Humanized Foxp2 differentially influences the functional contributions of the associative and sensorimotor striatum to learning dynamics compared with the wt.
Foxp2hum/hum mice exhibited an altered interaction between the declarative and procedural learning strategies, favoring the procedural system when both learning systems were engaged as indicated by their more rapid transition toward procedural behavior in contrast to the wt.
The relation between declarative and procedural learning strategies and language learning is itself unclear. A Hypothesis raised by the authors is that efficient proceduralization might accelerate probabilistic learning of language features by chunking single speech and language related actions into sequences, a feature potentially contributing to adapting the human brain for speech and language acquisition.

# Summary

FoxP2 is a very highly conserved protein that retains close similarity and even identity between comparatively unrelated organisms.
