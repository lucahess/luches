sequencing is error prone! need to compensate

to have whole genome present in the end, need to oversample => sequence so often,
that you have at least a couple representations of each sequence
because by chance PCR amplifies some areas less (less ideal for binding).

Getting an oversampling is also important, so when you get errors, you have
statistical data to back up the most likely base at that position.

Read depth/coverage: statistically want whole genome represented many times
(high quality at least 30-50x!)
=> read depth: how many times each base in the genome is represented

Know differences between primary databases and curated and reviewed databases!

But course is more about analysing, less the understanding.

Different large databases on cancer variants have different focuses!

Civic database is where researchers can contribute directly to the annotations. 
Makes it easier to have more broad representation of genome variant data.
